<h1 class="title toc-ignore">The Luminaries</h1>
<h4 class="date"><em>26 August 2016</em></h4>

</div>


<p>Last year I read Eleanor Catton’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Booker_Prize">award</a>-winning <a href="http://dimpost.wordpress.com/2013/07/17/on-what-the-luminaries-is-actually-like">yarn</a> <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/13687338">The Luminaries</a></em>. I started a little project around it, which is temporarily stalled (watch this space<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>), but recently a colleague remarked about the chapter lengths and I was reminded I had this data.</p>
<p>The novel has a number of structural constraints, one of which is that each of the 12 parts is half the length of the previous one.</p>
<p>Or are they?<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<div id="htmlwidget-f34054120b04ae4cd16b" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="plotly html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-f34054120b04ae4cd16b">{"x":{"layout":{"margin":{"b":40,"l":60,"t":25,"r":10},"title":"Divisions in The Luminaries (Hardback)","xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"dtick":1,"title":"Part"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"title":"Pages"}},"config":{"modeBarButtonsToRemove":["sendDataToCloud"]},"base_url":"https://plot.ly","source":"A","data":[{"x":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],"y":[360,158,104,96,38,26,16,10,6,8,6,4],"text":["A Sphere within a Sphere","Auguries","The House of Self-Undoing","Paenga-wha-wha","Weight and Lucre","The Widow and the Weeds","Domicile","The Truth About Aurora","Mutable Earth","Matters of Succession","Orion Sets When Scorpio Rises","The Old Moon and the Young Moon's Arms"],"type":"bar","marker":{"fillcolor":"rgba(31,119,180,1)","color":"rgba(31,119,180,1)","line":{"color":"transparent"}},"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y"}]},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>You can see easily at a glance that the pages decrease, but they don’t reliably halve. Notably, parts three and four are not too different. The tail doesn’t look to decrease like that, but in part that’s due to pages being a less reliable indicator for length when they’re that short.</p>
<p>First, why does the length decrease at all? Well each part has different divisions — Part <em>n</em> has 13–<em>n</em> chapters — so that’s one thing. The only comment I’ve seen is from a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/eleanor-catton-booker-prize-winner-the-luminaries">a reviewer who said</a> it “mimic[s] the moon waning through its lunar cycle”, but I don’t know whether that’s just a guess.</p>
<div id="from-pages-to-words" class="section level3">
<h3>From pages to words</h3>
<p>I do have word counts though, so lets look at that instead.</p>
<div id="htmlwidget-8ff34240eed26a4e44fa" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="plotly html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-8ff34240eed26a4e44fa">{"x":{"layout":{"margin":{"b":40,"l":60,"t":25,"r":10},"title":"Divisions in The Luminaries","xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"dtick":1,"title":"Part"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"title":"Words"}},"config":{"modeBarButtonsToRemove":["sendDataToCloud"]},"base_url":"https://plot.ly","source":"A","data":[{"x":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],"y":[131441,55492,31833,29879,10371,6442,2430,953,455,439,208,96],"text":["A Sphere within a Sphere","Auguries","The House of Self-Undoing","Paenga-wha-wha","Weight and Lucre","The Widow and the Weeds","Domicile","The Truth About Aurora","Mutable Earth","Matters of Succession","Orion Sets When Scorpio Rises","The Old Moon and the Young Moon's Arms"],"type":"bar","marker":{"fillcolor":"rgba(31,119,180,1)","color":"rgba(31,119,180,1)","line":{"color":"transparent"}},"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y"}]},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>Still you can see that it’s not halving each time. And those later parts are getting hard to see. So let’s look at the ratios.</p>
<p>First, I’ll point out that each chapter begins with a little summary text. At the very first chapter, this is a brief couple of lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In which a stranger arrives in Hokitika; a secret council is disturbed; Walter Moody conceals his most recent memory; and Thomas Balfour begins to tell a story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which does very briefly summarise the plot. In the very final chapter, the summary is longer than the actual text, and gives more plot. Should these count when we’re comparing them? Let’s have a look.</p>
<p>The next plot shows the ratio of each Part to the one before, looking at the summary, the main text, and both together.</p>

<p>Looking at this, you can see<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> that only a few parts are actually half their predecessor, even if you’re being generous and allow a 10% margin on either side.</p>
<p>Including or excluding the summary text doesn’t seem to have a consistent effect.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-by-chapter" class="section level3">
<h3>Chapter by chapter</h3>
<p>As mentioned, each part is split into 13–<em>n</em> chapters. Naturally, the next question is “what do the chapters look like?”</p>

<p>There’s no clear pattern I can see here.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> On the whole, the lengths are decreasing, but certainly not in a uniform way. Chapter 13 is very obvious at one end, and 35/37 at the other. The latter two offer an explanation for why Part 4 is about the same length as Part 3.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I think we can say that “each successive part halves in length” is not an accurate description of <em>The Luminaries</em>. The only constraint seems to be the number of chapters in each part, decreasing by one each time. This combines with the general trend for the chapters to get smaller to produce the descreasing trend that many people have mistaken for halving.</p>
<p>I haven’t included the code (or raw <a href="https://github.com/dakvid/dakvid.github.io/tree/source/data">data</a> ) in this post, but if you’re interested, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dakvid/dakvid.github.io/source/2016-08-the-luminaries.Rmd">it’s available</a> in the source branch on GitHub.</p>
