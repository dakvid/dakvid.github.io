Recently we had local body elections in New Zealand. (You may [have heard](2016-10-whither-local-democracy.html).)
[Single Transferable Vote](http://www.stv.govt.nz) (STV) was used for 7 of the 67
territorial authorities (city and district councils),
for 1 of the 11 regional councils, and for 19 of the 20 district health boards^[The
DHBs are legally mandated to use STV --- one of them didn't have elections this year.].
STV is Simple To Vote, but it can also be Strenuous To Vet --- understanding how the
votes are counted and the results are calculated is much less intuitive than
First Past the Post (FPP).

So here are some animations to hopefully make the process in New Zealand a little
easier to understand.

## Voting

Voting is pretty straightforward. Instead of picking the single candidate you prefer (or _n_ candidates if
there are _n_ seats), you rank all of the candidates in your order of preference. 
In theory this is pretty simple, but it can be quite an exercise if there are a lot of candidates
and you don't know much about them (a common complaint about the district health boards).

One nice thing is that you don't really need to think "strategically". The best strategy really is
to rank Person A ahead of Person B if you would prefer them to be elected, and vice versa.
In comparison, with FPP (and [MMP](http://www.elections.org.nz/voting-system/mmp-voting-system)
party selection) you have to consider "wasted" votes, the threat of
"[splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting)" the vote etc.
Graham Edgeler [has a good discussion](http://publicaddress.net/legalbeagle/voting-in-an-stv-election/)
of some of the facts.^[It is theoretically possible to vote "strategically" in STV, but it is
NP-complete to determine, so it's not really something that comes into play.
[(Bartholdi and Orlin, 1990)](http://diafaneia.ee.auth.gr/sites/default/files/stv.pdf)]

In New Zealand, unlike some other jurisdictions, we are not required to rank all candidates. A ballot
only needs to have a single candidate ranked 1 to be valid. Some people just do this (at a guess, people
who are used to FPP and haven't cottoned on to STV yet); some only vote for the number of seats available.
Others only vote for those they like --- though there is still benefit to ranking people you dislike higher than
people you despise. Another phenomenon is people ranking the tail of candidates in the order they appear
on the paper --- some jurisdictions randomise the ballot listing to avoid advantaging Aaron Aardvark
over Ziggy Zebra.^[I trust that concrete evidence exists for all of the things I've mentioned in this paragraph,
but I've only seen them mentioned in discussion and haven't felt moved to try and track down references
for you. Sorry.]

An important point is that you only have one vote at a time --- initially your first preference. If
your current vote doesn't count anymore (we'll get to that) then it transfers to your next preference.

One advantage of this is when candidates withdraw. There were several cases in 2016 of people running
for both mayor and council ward, or council ward and community board --- if they win the former then
they are [automatically withdrawn](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2001/0035/latest/DLM94710.html)
from the latter. In areas using FPP, their votes in the latter race are
wasted.^[For example, in [Waipa District Council](http://www.waipadc.govt.nz/our-council/Elections/Pages/Results.aspx),
Sue Milner was elected to the council in the Cambridge Ward. She also stood for the Cambridge Subdivision
(a community board), where she was the third highest polling of seven candidates for four seats.
This meant that 16.8% of votes cast --- alternatively, one of the four votes cast by 67.1% of voters --- were
wasted. Given that she received 2,722 votes, and the gap between 4th and 7th was 506 votes, it's quite
conceivable that one or two of the candidates elected could have been different if she had not stood.
]
In areas using STV, the election is no different to if they had not been on the ballot paper.^[For example,
in [Kapiti Coast District Council](http://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/Your-Council/The-Role-of-Council/elections2016/),
K Gurunathan won the mayoralty so all of the votes cast for him as
a Districtwide councillor just passed on to the next preference. There were 490 people (2.8%) who voted
for him only so their votes could be seen to be wasted. But considering there were 13 people standing
for 5 seats I think we can assume that they thought the others were ratbags and wouldn't have voted
for anyone if "Guru" wasn't on the ballot. `:-)`]

## Counting

What happens after the initial first preferences are tallied is an interesting question with many
answers. STV is actually a family of voting systems, and there are a variety of methods for determining
quotas, excluding candidates and transferring votes. A [Wikipedia article provides a reasonable
summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_single_transferable_votes). The systems used in
Scotland, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand (and elsewhere) all differ slightly.

In New Zealand we use a system devised by [Meek in 1969](http://www.votingmatters.org.uk/ISSUE1/P1.HTM)
and enshrined in the [Local Electoral Act 2001](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2001/0035/latest/DLM93301.html).


### Single Seat

For a single seat election, STV is also known as Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV) and Preferential Voting.
Simply, a candidate needs to get 50% of the votes to win --- if no candidate has enough votes then
the lowest polling candidates are eliminated, transferring their votes to the next preferences.
Candidates are eliminated until somebody reaches the 50% quota / threshold.

```

The 2016 mayoralty race in Palmerston North is a simple example of an election being determined
on first preferences, giving exactly the same result as FPP. Incumbant mayor Grant Smith received
18,773 votes (94.8%) and was elected on the first iteration, having exceeded the 50% quota of
9,899 votes. [Convicted child assaulter](http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/83124328/mayoral-contest-in-palmerston-north-to-cost-30000)
Ross Barber received only 1,024 votes (5.2%).

#### Example: Wellington Regional Council, Kapiti Coast 2016

In 2016, the Kapiti Coast constituency of the Wellington Regional Council had three candidates
vying for one seat. 16,455 valid ballots were returned, so the initial quota to be elected was
`16455 / 2 = 8227.5`.

First preferences were distributed among Penny Gaylor (6,736 / 40.9%), Nigel Wilson (6,704 / 40.7%) and
Peter Bollmann (3,015 / 18.3%). Since nobody reached the quota Bollmann, the lowest candidate, was
excluded and his votes transferred to their next preferences.

Of those that preferred Bollmann, 1,010 next preferred Gaylor and 687 preferred Wilson. Additionally,
1,318 didn't rank anyone else at all so their votes are set aside. Now the quota is half of the remaining
votes, i.e. `(16455 - 1318) / 2 = 7568.5`. Gaylor now has 7,746 votes so is elected. Wilson is excluded
as the seat has been filled.

Here is the same information in an animated chart. You'll see that I've split each iteration
into three steps to make it a little clearer --- assigning the votes, calculating the quota, 
and making a decision on what to do next.

![animated bar graph of 2016 Wellington Regional Council Kapiti Coast Constituency STV election results](images/stv/stv2016_wrc_kapiti.gif)

#### Example: Wellington City Council, Mayor 2016

The 2016 election for Wellington Mayor featured eight hopeful candidates. This was a longer but
still simple election. The order of the candidates never changes from first preference, with
winner Justin Lester rising from 36.5% of first preferences to 56.4% going head-to-head against
runner up Nick Leggett.

Interestingly, in the 7th and final iteration 8,434 voters (13.0%) ranked neither of the top
two candidates (and up to 66.0% of those had voted only for the third place getter Jo Coughlan).

![animated bar graph of 2016 Wellington City Council Mayor STV election](images/stv/stv2016_wcc_mayor.gif)

#### Example: Wellington City Council, Mayor 2010

The same election six years previous provides an interesting example of the difference that STV
can make.

In the first iteration, incumbant two-term mayor Kerry Prendergast led challenger Celia Wade-Brown
21,809 votes (40.9%) to 18,560 votes (34.8%).
In the fifth iteration, Wade-Brown finally pipped Prendergast to win 24,881 votes (50.2%) to
24,705 (49.8%).

Prendergast, who came to power under FPP^[I haven't located any speculation or data on this, but
I recall my feeling at the time being that she would not have won under STV.] and won a second
term under STV, [claimed this result was "undemocratic"](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/4225729/STV-system-may-cost-me-election-says-Prendergast).
I disagree. I read the first preference votes not that "more voters prefer Prendergast to any
other candidate", but that "3/5th of voters would rather have someone other than Prendergast".
Running the STV iterations allows us to discover that more voters preferred Wade-Brown to
Prendergast, so her election is the most democratic outcome (given the low voter turnout).

### Multiple Seats

STV elections for multiple seats work similarly to a single seat in that first preference votes
are used initially, and the lowest polling candidate is excluded and their votes are transferred
to the next preference (if any). The quota that has to be reached in order to be elected is the
number of votes divided by one plus the number of seats. So if there are two seats you need one
third of the votes, for three seats you need one quarter, and so on.

The main difference is what to do with the votes of candidates who are elected when there are
still unfilled seats. In the Meek system, the elected candidate keeps just enough votes to stay
over the threshold, and their "surplus" votes are transferred to the subsequent preferences.
Importantly (and perhaps confusingly), the surplus votes are transferred proportionately based
on the subsequent preferences of _all_ votes for the candidate, so there are likely to be
fractional votes from this point.

#### Example: Wellington Regional Council, Porirua-Tawa 2016

Moving south from the Kapiti Coast, the Porirua-Tawa constituency had four candidates vying for
two seats on the Wellington Regional Council in 2016.
On first preferences, Jenny Brash has 7,705 (45%) of the 17,003 votes, easily surpassing the
quota of `17003 / 3 = 5667.7`.
Trailing behind are Barbara Donaldson with 4,649 (27.3%), Joern Scherzer with 2,709 (15.9%),
and Heidi Mills with 1,940 (11.4%).

Now Brash has 2,037.3 surplus votes she "doesn't need", as they are above the quota, and which
can be transferred to the other candidates.

Of the 7,705 people who preferred Brash, 3,728 people (48.4%) next preferred Donaldson,
1,013 people (13.1%) preferred Scherzer, 1,129 (14.7%) preferred Mills, and 1,835 people
(23.8%) had ranked nobody else.

```{r wrcpt_table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
brash <- dplyr::data_frame(
  `First Pref` = c("Brash", "Brash", "Brash", "Brash", "Donaldson", "Scherzer", "Mills"),
  `Second Pref` = c("Donaldson", "Scherzer", "Mills", "---", "?", "?", "?"),
  `Third Pref` = c("?", "?", "?", "---", "?", "?", "?"),
  Voters = c("3,728", "1,013", "1,129", "1,835", "4,649", "2,709", "1,940")
)
```

`r knitr::kable(brash)`

Thus, in the second iteration, Donaldson now has 5,634.7 votes --- her original 4,649 first
preference votes and 48.4% (985.7) of Brash's 2,037.3 surplus votes.
Since 485.2 votes (23.8% of 2,037.3) have been removed from Brash and not transferred to
anyone else, the quota now drops to `(17003 - 485.2) / 3 = 5505.9`.
Donaldson's votes exceed the quota, so she is elected.

Here is an animation of the calculations.

![animated bar graph of 2016 Wellington Regional Council Porirua-Tawa constituancy STV election](images/stv/stv2016_wrc_porirua-tawa.gif)

Note that if there had been a third seat in contention, the next action would not have been
to exclude the lowest polling candidate but again to transfer surplus votes. Donaldson
has 128.8 surplus votes, but Brash also has 161.8 surplus votes, as the quota has reduced
since the original surplus was calculated. Brash would transfer a few more votes to
Donaldson, but it is likely that Donaldson will also transfer some votes to Brash,
as there may have been voters that ranked Donaldson 1st and Brash 2nd. In larger
elections these mutual transfers can take several iterations to reach an equilibrium.

#### Example: Kapiti Coast District Council, Waikanae Community Board 2016

The 2016 Waikanae Community Board was the result of a strongly contested race between
nine candidates for four seats, with a count lasting 11 iterations.

Incumbant and local pharmacist James Westbury is elected in the first iteration,
with 1,592 votes (29.9%) easily surpassing the quota of 1064.6 votes.

In the following five iterations, Westbury's surplus is transferred, and the bottom
four candidates are excluded.

In the 7th iteration, Jocelyn Prvanov and Tonchi Begovich both exceed the quota and
are elected. 

Over the following three iterations the surplus of the three winners is transferred.
There is a lot of mutual transfer, perhaps not surprising as they campaigned together.

Finally, at iteration 11, the final seat is decided as Jeremy Seamark narrowly exceeds
the quota. Incumbant Eric Gregory is excluded.

        $(this).attr("src", "images/stv/stv2016_kcdc_waikanae_cb.gif");
        return false;
    });
});
</script>


## Iterations

I found it interesting to see the variation in length of the counting process for the elections.
Some were over in a couple of iterations, others in a couple of dozen. The clear winner was the
Dunedin City Council's At Large election, which took 82 iterations to be decided.

There are no doubt a range of factors that can increase or decrease the number of iterations, but
the strongest single variable looks, unsurprisingly, to be the number of candidates standing.

```{r iterations, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
stv16 <- read_csv("data/local2016/summary_stv_counts.csv", skip = 2)
library(plotly)
plot_ly() %>% 
  add_markers(data = stv16, 
              x = ~candidates, 
              y = ~iterations, 
              size = ~4*seats,
              text = ~paste0(body, ifelse(is.na(election), "", paste(", ", election)), " (", seats, " seats)<br />",
                             candidates, " candidates + ", seats, " seats = ", iterations, " iterations"),
              hoverinfo = "text")
#ggplot(stv16, aes(x = candidates, y = iterations, size = 2*(seats), colour = factor(seats))) + geom_point()
```



## Post Script

I've found this an interesting process, both technically learning how to make the graphs with
[gganimate](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate) and [tweenr](https://github.com/thomasp85/tweenr),
and getting a better understanding of how the STV counting works. I've always been in
favour of using STV for these elections, but haven't fully understood the counting process
(especially the fractional votes).

I had planned to write a technical post about creating the animations, but I'm not sure if
I will now. Either way I'll make the code available at some point. In the meantime, I would
recommend Len Kiefer's excellent posts for making a start at something like this.^[[Improving R animated GIFs with
tweenr](http://lenkiefer.com/2016/05/29/improving-R-animated-gifs-with-tweenr) and
[More tweenr animation examples](http://lenkiefer.com/2016/05/30/more-tweenr-animations)]

I have created more animations, and did plan to include more in the post, but they start to
get quite large (36MB in one case). I'm aiming to create animations for all of 2016's elections,
and it might be sensible to start a separate repository to handle that.
