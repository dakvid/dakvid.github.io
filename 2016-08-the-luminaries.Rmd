Last year I read Eleanor Catton's 
award-wining
masterpiece
The Luminaries.
I started a little project around it, which is temporarily stalled (watch this space^[Maybe - I have a number of stalled projects!]), but recently a colleague remarked about the chapter lengths and I was reminded I had this data.

The novel has a number of structural constraints, one of which is that each of the 12 parts is half the length of the previous one. Or are they?

```{r pages}
plot_ly(
  hardback,
  x = Part,
  y = Pages,
  text = Title,
  type = "bar"
) %>% 
  layout(title = "Divisions in The Luminaries (Hardback)")
```
