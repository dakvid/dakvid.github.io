      <description>I don't know what I'm more excited about - new election results to pore over, or my first follow-up post! In 2016 I looked at voter turnout in the New Zealand local body elections. Now three years later, almost to the day, let's have a look again and see how things have turned out this year. Is it Democracy In Action or Democracy Inaction?</description>

      <description>I made a map at work comparing Auckland and other New Zealand cities.

      <title>Leaders' Ages</title>
      <dc:creator>David Friggens</dc:creator>
      <link>https://david.frigge.nz/posts/2018-11-leader-age</link>
      <description>_The Economist_ used some graphs to show "Leaders of Western economies
are getting younger, even as their populations age".
Naturally my first question was "what about New Zealand?"</description>

      <title>A Radixal Approach to Blogging</title>

      <description>The blog is dead. Long live the blog!
The blog went in to unintentional hiatus as I had enough of handling things
manually with RMarkdown. I've converted it to use the new radix package, and
written some notes about the process.</description>

      <description>If you live in New Zealand you would have been hard pressed not to notice that we had local body elections recently. It seems that all anyone can talk about is the turnout. Is it all bad news?</description>
