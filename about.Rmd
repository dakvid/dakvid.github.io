I'd have loved to use [Peter Gutmann](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/)'s, but it's probably safer to be straight.

### About Me

I currently find myself working as an analyst (data scientist?) in government, which I'm really enjoying.
My academic background is mathematical logic and theoretical computer science, and I spent some years
working in libraries. Most of my time outside of work is consumed by my family for now.

I occasionally find time to play around with code and data for my own curiosity, and this is
proving to be an easy and convenient place to publish things I want to share.
And it also gives me the incentive to stop my ```skunkworks``` folder from looking too much like this:
