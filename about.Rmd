### About Me

I currently find myself working as a data analyst (data scientist?) in the private
sector, after several years in public sector organisations.
My academic background is mathematical logic and theoretical computer science, and I spent some years
working in libraries. Most of my time outside of work is consumed by my young family for now.

I occasionally find time to play around with code and data for my own curiosity,
and having a blog is
proving to be an easy and convenient place to publish things I want to share.
And it also gives me the incentive to stop my ```skunkworks``` folder from looking too much like this:

### Disclaimer

Nothing in here is my own view, but was forced upon me at gunpoint by my wife.
(Apologies to [Peter Gutmann](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/).)

More seriously, this site is entirely personal --- any views are nothing to do with any previous, current, or future employers.
