<h1>Democracy-in-action</h1>
<p>I don’t know what I’m more excited about - new election results to pore over, or my first follow-up post! In 2016 I looked at voter turnout in the New Zealand local body elections. Now three years later, almost to the day, let’s have a look again and see how things have turned out this year. Is it Democracy In Action or Democracy Inaction?</p>

<div class="d-article">
<p>Three years ago <a href="../2016-10-whither-local-democracy">I looked at voter turnout in the 2016 local body elections</a> in New Zealand. There was a lot of concern about the low voter turnout, though overall the turnout was slightly higher than 2013. This was driven by the “metro” councils, which countered the decline in the “provincial” and “rural” councils.</p>
<p>Fellow kiwis will likely have heard similar rumblings about dropping voter turnout again, so let’s see what actually happened. Luckily I was reminded from my previous post that Local Government NZ <a href="https://www.lgnz.co.nz/vote2019/voters/preliminary-voter-turnout-2019/">collates all the data</a>, which saved me the nightmare of visiting every individual council’s website. You can go to their page to see some Excel column charts, or you can stay here for a repeat of the dumbbell plots.</p>
<aside>
Yes, it’s 2019 and local council websites are still an eclectic mix of volume, frequency and (especially) file types when it comes to voting data.

<h2 id="high-level-summaries">High-level summaries</h2>
<p>After a big drop between 2010 and 2013 and a smaller movement in 2016, there appears to be another big drop in turnout across the board. The national figures apparently suggest an overall increase, but this must be a mistake. These are preliminary figures, and I’ll update when final numbers are confirmed.</p>

The four-value dumbbells hopefully aren’t too cluttered. I was going to drop 2010 off to make it cleaner, but I think it’s better to keep it to make clearer the story of an ongoing drop.
</aside>
<p>Whilst it’s positive to see that rural and provincial districts have good turnout relative to the metro areas, they only make up a third of the population. To put this in perspective, let’s turn these percentages into people.</p>

2019 turnout figures haven’t been released yet for Porirua, New Plymouth or Clutha. I’ll update these in the coming days.

<p>As expected there is a lot of variation, with big jumps both up and down over 2016. Most areas record a drop though, with the largest increases generally being in small districts. Only two metro areas had (very small) increases: Christchurch and [Lower] Hutt. The biggest metro drops were in Auckland and Wellington — two of the three biggest areas.</p>
