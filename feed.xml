		    <title>Unfamiliar Maps</title>
		    <description>At least 3 people have booked flights to Sydney, Nova Scotia (population 30,000) intending to holiday in New South Wales (two orders of magnitude larger). There are a number of cases like this of towns and cities with larger and more well known doppelgangers. I thought it would be interesting to have a map that labelled the familiar names in the unfamiliar locations.</description>

				<title>Birthday Eve</title>
