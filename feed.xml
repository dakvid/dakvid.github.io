		    <title>The Luminaries</title>
		    <description>Last year I read Eleanor Catton's award-winning yarn The Luminaries. I started a little project around it, which is temporarily stalled (watch this space), but recently a colleague remarked about the chapter lengths and I was reminded I had this data.<br />The novel has a number of structural constraints, one of which is that each of the 12 parts is half the length of the previous one.<br />Or are they?</description>

		    <title>Unfamiliar Maps</title>
		    <description>At least 3 people have booked flights to Sydney, Nova Scotia (population 30,000) intending to holiday in New South Wales (two orders of magnitude larger). There are a number of cases like this of towns and cities with larger and more well known doppelgangers. I thought it would be interesting to have a map that labelled the familiar names in the unfamiliar locations.</description>

				<title>Birthday Eve</title>
					<description>Some time ago I had a thought - if you had a daughter and she was born on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve, would you be tempted to name her Eve?</description>
