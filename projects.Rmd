  Some of my projects that aren't in the blog.

[STV Elections in New Zealand](https://david.frigge.nz/stvnz) (2019)

:   Animations of Single Transferable Vote elections, and an attempt to collate
the detailed counting data in one place.


[30 Day Map Challenge](https://david.frigge.nz/map30days) (2019)

:   People on Twitter tried to make 30 maps in a month and I tried to tag along.


[NZ Election Visualisation 2017](https://david.frigge.nz/election2017)

:   Various visualisations of results from the 2017 general election in
New Zealand - dumbbells of party gains/losses relative to the previous election,
hexagonal cartograms of electorate results, and a foray into 3d hexagons.
It's also a nice use of [flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/).

    Since the blog was having a snooze it got its own
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/dakvid/election2017).


[NZ Election Visualisation 2014](https://david.frigge.nz/nzhex2014)

:   Hexagonal cartograms of the 2014 general election results. This was before
the blog and (my use of) GitHub, so I published them using Google Drive. Now
that Google has killed that functionality they can live in perpetuity thanks to
GitHub.
