           "Last year I read Eleanor Catton's award-winning yarn The Luminaries. I started a little project around it, which is temporarily stalled (watch this space), but recently a colleague remarked about the chapter lengths and I was reminded I had this data.

New South Wales (two orders of magnitude larger). There are a number of cases like this of towns and cities
with larger and more well known doppelgangers. 
I thought it would be interesting to have a map that labelled the familiar names in the unfamiliar locations.")
